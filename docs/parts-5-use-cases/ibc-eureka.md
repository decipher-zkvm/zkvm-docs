# IBC Eureka

## What is IBC Eureka?
IBC Eureka is a next-generation interoperability solution developed within the Cosmos ecosystem. It represents the first implementation of IBC v2 and serves as the official protocol for securely connecting Cosmos chains with external networks such as Ethereum.

Whereas the original IBC (IBC v1) primarily focused on inter-chain connections within the Cosmos ecosystem, Eureka goes beyond this by enabling direct, trust-minimized, bidirectional communication between Cosmos and Ethereum.

From a technical perspective, IBC Eureka adopts a light client–based message authentication architecture. To address the structural constraints of external chains like Ethereum (e.g., high gas costs), it leverages off-chain proof generation via a zkVM.
Specifically, on the Ethereum side, Eureka employs the SP1 zkVM to execute the Cosmos Hub’s light client algorithm off-chain and then verifies the resulting zkSNARK proof on-chain.

## Why is IBC Eureka Needed?

### Structural Limitations of IBC v1
The IBC protocol fundamentally operates by running mutual light clients. For example, to connect with Ethereum, the Cosmos chain must host an Ethereum light client on-chain, and Ethereum must, in turn, host a Cosmos light client.

However, due to Ethereum’s high on-chain computation costs and its limited capacity, directly running a Tendermint-based light client on Ethereum has been practically infeasible. As a temporary workaround, some solutions introduced multisig-based or external third-party bridges. These approaches, however, compromised IBC’s trust model and introduced potential security vulnerabilities.

### A zkVM-Based Solution
IBC Eureka addresses this challenge by enabling Tendermint-based block verification on Ethereum through off-chain light client verification powered by the SP1 zkVM.

As a result, it enables trust-minimized, bidirectional connectivity between Ethereum and Cosmos, while preserving the original security principles of IBC. In short, Eureka achieves both scalability and usability without sacrificing security.

### How IBC Eureka Works: Light Clients and zkVM Integration

**Architecture Overview**

Eureka deploys the following components on each chain:

- Cosmos side
    - Runs an Ethereum light client (ICS-08 in Wasm form) within CosmWasm.
- Ethereum side
    - Does not execute the Cosmos light client directly. Instead, it receives zkSNARK proofs generated by executing the Cosmos light client logic inside the SP1 zkVM.

- Initiating from Cosmos Hub
    - A user starts an IBC transfer from Cosmos Hub to Ethereum.
- Smart Relayer’s Role
    - Fetching Consensus Data
        - The Smart Relayer retrieves consensus state data from the Cosmos Hub.
    - Requesting Proof from the Succinct Prover Network
        - Using the retrieved data, it requests the Succinct Prover Network to generate a zk proof confirming the validity of the consensus state.
- Proof Generation by the Succinct Prover Network
    - Internally, the SP1 zkVM executes the Tendermint light client logic. A resulting ZKP is returned to the Smart Relayer.
- Submitting to Ethereum
    - The Smart Relayer submits both the ZKP and the IBC packet to Ethereum.
- On-Chain Verification in Ethereum

SP1 is capable of executing Rust-based Tendermint light client code and producing SNARK proofs for the execution results. These proofs serve as cryptographic attestations of the Cosmos chain’s state, enabling Ethereum to trustlessly update its view of the Cosmos blockchain.

### Performance and Cost Efficiency
- **Low Transaction Costs:** Transferring assets from Ethereum to a Cosmos chain costs around $5 in “fast mode” and under $1 in “standard mode.”
- **Near-Instant Finality:** Even if the source chain’s finality time is relatively long, assets can arrive at the destination chain within seconds.
