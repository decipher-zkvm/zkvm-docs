## RISC-Zero: Upcoming Cluster Launch

RISC Zero makes Real-Time Proving accessible to everyone.


- Speed: Aiming for an end-to-end proof generation speed of about 9.25 seconds.

- Accessibility: Real-time proving is possible on GPU equipment costing around $120,000, and the GPU implementation is provided as 100% open source.

With a cluster costing around $120,000, RISC Zero will be able to reduce Ethereum block proofing time to under 12 seconds.

If Real-Time ZK requires million-dollar equipment, the proving pipeline will become centralized. However, at around $120,000, the Ethereum Foundation (EF), staking pools, and small teams can all operate Real-Time Provers themselves. This way, real-time proving can secure the same Liveness guarantees expected from Ethereum.
